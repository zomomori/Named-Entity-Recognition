### Named Entity Recognition on movie related search queries

I utilized PyTorch to implement advanced natural language processing techniques of relation extraction and named entity recognition. 
<br /><br />
Specifically, I created a Multilayer Perceptron model to identify knowledge graph relations within user queries related to movies and a Bidirectional LSTM model for classifying and tagging each token in the text with its corresponding movie-related category.
<br /><br />
Through this process, I was able to achieve an F-1 score of 0.81 on the relation extraction model and 0.85 on the named entity recognition model.
